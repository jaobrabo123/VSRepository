# `select` and `relations`

v1's named, reusable `selectModels`/`defaultSelectModel` are gone. In v2 you pass `select` and `relations` directly on each call — there's nothing to pre-register:

```typescript
const user = await userRepository.get(id, {
    select: { id: true, name: true, address: { city: true } },
});

const userWithAddress = await userRepository.get(id, {
    relations: { address: true },
});
```

- `select` mirrors the entity's shape: scalar fields take a `boolean`; relation fields take a `boolean` or a nested `select`.
- `relations` eagerly loads related records; each relation field takes a `boolean` or a nested `relations` object.
- Whether `select` and `relations` can be combined depends on the adapter (see below).

> ⚠️ **Adapter-dependent behavior for `relations`:**
>
> The core only forwards `MethodOptions.select` and `MethodOptions.relations` to the adapter — each adapter decides how to translate them to the underlying ORM:
>
> - **Prisma 7 (`@vsrepo/prisma7-adapter` / `VSRepoPrisma7Adapter`)** — `relations` is converted to Prisma `include` (`parsePrismaInclude`). **If `select` is present, `relations` is ignored** because Prisma does not allow `select` + `include` in the same query:
>     ```typescript
>     // Prisma7: relations is ignored when select exists
>     await userRepository.get(id, {
>         select: { id: true, name: true },
>         relations: { address: true }, // ← ignored, include = undefined
>     });
>     ```
>
> Custom adapters may map `relations` differently — consult the adapter's documentation for the exact semantics.

## Strict return typing with `InferMethodReturn`

By default, methods are typed as returning the **whole entity**, ignoring the `select` and `relations` you pass (the same approach TypeORM takes). If you prefer a stricter type, `InferMethodReturn<T, Options>` narrows it to what was actually requested. It is opt-in and purely a type-level utility — nothing changes at runtime.

```typescript
import type { InferMethodReturn, MethodOptions } from "vsrepo";

type Address = { id: string; city: string };
type Product = { id: string; name: string };
type User = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    address: Address | null;
    products: Product[];
};

const options = {
    select: { id: true, name: true, products: { id: true } },
} satisfies MethodOptions<User>;

const users: InferMethodReturn<User[], typeof options> = await userRepository.getAll(options);
// { id: string; name: string; products: { id: string }[] }[]
```

- The **first** type argument is what the method returns: `User`, `User | null` or `User[]`. `null` and array-ness are preserved — also on relation fields (`address: Address | null`).
- The **second** is the options object passed to the method (`typeof options`). It can be omitted, which is the same as passing no options.

| Options passed         | Inferred result                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| None (or `{}`)         | Only the scalar fields of the entity — no relations.                                                                                                                                         |
| `relations`            | The scalar fields plus the requested relations (nested ones included); each relation brings all of its scalar fields.                                                                        |
| `select`               | Only the selected fields. A relation set to `true` brings all of its scalar fields; a nested `select` restricts it further. Relations selected this way are loaded even without `relations`. |
| `select` + `relations` | `select` wins and `relations` is ignored.                                                                                                                                                    |

- `see` and `db` don't affect the result.
- Keep the options' literal types, using `satisfies MethodOptions<T>` (as above) or passing them inline. If they are typed as a plain `MethodOptions<T>` (e.g. `const options: MethodOptions<User> = ...`), nothing is known at compile time and `T` is returned unchanged.
- Optional (`?`) fields and relations of the entity stay optional.
- To get this inference directly on dynamic methods, see [Strict return typing with `InferMethodType`](./dynamic-methods.md#strict-return-typing-with-infermethodtype).
