/**
 * Opt-in **strict** return typing: narrows the type returned by a repository method
 * according to the `select` / `relations` that were actually passed to it.
 *
 * By default, `VSRepository` methods type their return as the whole entity, ignoring
 * `select` and `relations` (the same approach TypeORM takes). Use this utility when you
 * prefer a tighter type:
 *
 * - **no `select`/`relations`** — only the scalar fields of the entity (no relations);
 * - **`relations`** — the scalar fields plus the requested relations (nested ones included);
 * - **`select`** — only the selected fields. A relation selected with `true` brings all of its
 *   scalar fields; a nested `select` restricts it further. Relations selected this way are
 *   loaded even without `relations`.
 *
 * `select` takes precedence over `relations`: when `select` is present, `relations` is
 * ignored by the type. This mirrors the Prisma 7 adapter and never promises fields an
 * adapter might not return.
 *
 * `see` and `db` don't affect the result type.
 *
 * The first type argument is what the method returns: `Entity`, `Entity | null` or
 * `Entity[]` — `null`/array-ness are preserved (also on relation fields, e.g.
 * `address: Address | null`).
 *
 * The options must keep their literal type, so declare them with `satisfies MethodOptions<T>`
 * (or inline). If the options are typed as plain `MethodOptions<T>`, nothing is known
 * at compile time and the whole entity `T` is returned unchanged (the default typing).
 *
 * @template T What the method returns: `Entity`, `Entity | null` or `Entity[]`.
 * @template Options The options object passed to the method (`typeof options`).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const options = {
 *     select: { id: true, name: true, products: { id: true } },
 * } satisfies MethodOptions<User>;
 *
 * const users: InferMethodReturn<User[], typeof options> = await userRepository.getAll(options);
 * // { id: string; name: string; products: { id: string }[] }[]
 * ```
